If you've added file and folder names to your `.gitignore` file but they are still being pushed to GitHub, there could be several reasons for this behavior. Here are some common issues and their solutions:

1. Files or folders were already committed:
   If the files or folders were committed before you added them to the `.gitignore` file, Git will continue to track them. To resolve this, you need to remove them from the Git repository using the following steps:
   - Run `git rm --cached filename` for each file or folder that you want to untrack. This will remove them from the Git index but keep them in your working directory.
   - Commit your changes with `git commit -m "Remove files from tracking"`.
   - Push the changes to GitHub.

2. Incorrect `.gitignore` patterns:
   Double-check your `.gitignore` file to ensure that the patterns are correctly specified. Patterns in `.gitignore` are relative to the location of the `.gitignore` file. Make sure you are using the correct syntax for patterns, such as wildcards (`*` and `?`) and directory separators (use `/` for Unix-like systems and `\` for Windows).

3. `.gitignore` not in the root directory:
   If your `.gitignore` file is not in the root directory of your Git repository, it may not be applied to the entire repository. Make sure your `.gitignore` is in the root directory.

4. Cached files need to be removed:
   If you've already committed files that should be ignored, you may need to remove them from the Git cache using `git rm --cached` and then commit the changes again.

5. Global or system-level ignores:
   Check if you have a global `.gitignore` file or system-level Git configuration that could be affecting the repository. These global settings may override repository-specific `.gitignore` files.

6. Case sensitivity:
   Be aware of case sensitivity in file and folder names. Git's behavior regarding case sensitivity may vary depending on your operating system. Ensure that the case in your `.gitignore` file matches the case in the actual file or folder names.

7. Already pushed to GitHub:
   If the files were already pushed to GitHub before adding them to `.gitignore`, you will need to follow up by creating a new commit that removes the files and then pushing the new commit to GitHub. Existing files on GitHub won't be affected by changes to the `.gitignore` file.

After resolving any of these issues, commit the changes and push them to GitHub, and the specified files and folders should be ignored in future pushes.

Rebasing in Git is a way to integrate changes from one branch into another by moving or "replaying" commits on top of another branch. It’s often used to maintain a clean, linear project history.

### Simple Example of Rebasing

Let’s say you have two branches: `main` and `feature`.

1. **Initial State:**
   - You start working on a new feature in the `feature` branch.
   - While you’re working, the `main` branch gets updated with new commits by other developers.

   ```
   main:    A---B---C
   feature: A---D---E
   ```

   Here, `A` is the common commit where `feature` branched off from `main`. `B` and `C` are new commits on `main`, and `D` and `E` are your commits on `feature`.

2. **Rebasing `feature` onto `main`:**
   - You want to incorporate the changes from `main` into your `feature` branch.
   - Instead of merging `main` into `feature` (which would create a merge commit), you rebase `feature` onto `main`.

   ```
   git checkout feature
   git rebase main
   ```

   This will replay your commits (`D` and `E`) on top of the latest `main` branch.

   ```
   main:    A---B---C
   feature: A---B---C---D'---E'
   ```

   Notice that `D` and `E` are now `D'` and `E'` because they are new commits created during the rebase process.

3. **Resolving Conflicts:**
   - If there are conflicts between your changes and the changes in `main`, Git will pause the rebase and ask you to resolve them.
   - After resolving conflicts, you continue the rebase:

   ```
   git rebase --continue
   ```

4. **Final State:**
   - Once the rebase is complete, your `feature` branch will have a linear history with the changes from `main` included.

   ```
   main:    A---B---C
   feature: A---B---C---D'---E'
   ```

### Key Points:
- **Rebasing rewrites history:** The commits in the `feature` branch are new commits (`D'` and `E'`) with different SHA-1 hashes.
- **Clean history:** Rebasing creates a linear history, which can be easier to read and understand.
- **Use with caution:** Since rebasing rewrites history, it’s generally not recommended to rebase commits that have already been pushed to a shared repository.

### When to Use Rebasing:
- When you want to keep a clean, linear project history.
- When you’re working on a feature branch and want to incorporate the latest changes from the main branch.

### When Not to Use Rebasing:
- On public branches where others might have based their work on the existing commits.

I hope this helps clarify how rebasing works in Git!
